## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Morev Aleksey

I became interested in programming in 2017, I enrolled in the School of Programmers, where I studied for 6 years. At this school, I gained a solid foundation in programming and also completed an additional course in web development. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in **Software Engineering in MIREA â€” Russian Technological University**

I chose **Frontend development** because I enjoy creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.
